# AirBnB Price Regression

Welcome to the "AirBnB Price Regression" project repository. In this project, we delve into predicting the prices of AirBnB listings in London, UK using regression techniques. By analyzing various features of the listings, we aim to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a given listing, helping both hosts and guests gain insights into pricing.

## Introduction

The primary goal of the "AirBnB Price Regression" project is to create a predictive model capable of estimating the prices of AirBnB listings in London. By analyzing a range of features associated with the listings, including location, room type, availability, and more, we aim to build a model that can offer valuable insights into pricing trends and help users make informed decisions.

## Data

We use a dataset of AirBnB listings in London, UK, obtained from a CSV file ('london-uk-airbnb.csv'). The dataset contains information about various attributes of the listings, such as host details, neighborhood, room type, availability, and pricing.

## Data Preprocessing

In this phase, we perform the following preprocessing steps on the dataset:

1. Removal of irrelevant columns: Columns such as 'neighbourhood_group', 'license', 'name', and 'host_name' were removed as they are not useful for our prediction task.
2. Handling missing values: Missing values in columns like 'last_review' and 'reviews_per_month' were addressed by filling them with appropriate values.
3. Feature engineering: We transformed the 'last_review' column into separate year, month, and day columns for better model performance.
4. Conversion of categorical features: We converted categorical features like 'neighbourhood' and 'room_type' into numerical representations for the model.

## Modeling

We employed a RandomForestRegressor model as the initial model to predict the prices of AirBnB listings. The data was split into training and testing sets, and the model was trained on the training set.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

We then fine-tuned the model using RandomizedSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters that optimize the model's performance. This step aims to enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model.

## Final Model

Based on the results of hyperparameter tuning, we built a final RandomForestRegressor model with the optimized hyperparameters. This model is expected to provide better predictions on unseen data.

## Results

The performance of our final model was evaluated using the test dataset. The model's R-squared score and predictions were compared against the actual prices to gauge its accuracy.

## Conclusion

The "AirBnB Price Regression" project demonstrates the process of predicting AirBnB listing prices in London using regression techniques. By preprocessing the data, training a model, tuning its hyperparameters, and evaluating its performance, we've created a tool that can estimate listing prices based on various attributes.

## Future Improvements

While the project provides a solid foundation for predicting AirBnB listing prices, there are several avenues for future improvements and enhancements:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features that could impact pricing, such as property amenities, distance to popular landmarks, and seasonal factors.
2. **Advanced Models**: Experiment with more advanced regression models like Gradient Boosting Regressors or Neural Networks to potentially achieve higher prediction accuracy.
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models using ensemble techniques to leverage the strengths of different algorithms.
4. **Data Augmentation**: Augment the dataset with additional information or external data sources to improve the model's generalization.
5. **Interactive Visualization**: Create interactive visualizations to provide users with an intuitive understanding of the factors influencing pricing.
